<!-- README.md is inlined by docs/hooks/readme_images.py (not pymdownx.snippets) to
     rewrite docs/screenshots/ paths to screenshots/ for mkdocs compatibility.
     If the hook is removed, pymdownx.snippets will process this directive instead,
     but images will be broken because docs/screenshots/ is invalid relative to docs/. -->
